# Build rust-toolchain image for CI jobs and Octez docker distribution.
#
# Reads the following environment variables:
#  - 'rust_toolchain_image_name'
#  - 'rust_toolchain_image_tag' (optional)
#  - 'CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_PIPELINE_ID': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_PIPELINE_URL': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_JOB_ID': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_JOB_URL': set by GitLab CI
#  - 'CI_COMMIT_SHA': set by GitLab CI
#
# The image is tagged with
# $rust_toolchain_image_name:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG and
# $rust_toolchain_image_name:TAG. If $rust_toolchain_image_tag is set,
# then TAG contains this value. If not, TAG contains a hash of this
# image's inputs.
#
# When running in the CI, $rust_toolchain_image_tag is not set. The
# image is tagged with the input hash. In order for subsequent jobs to
# use the image built by this script, it stores the TAG in a dotenv
# file that is passed as artifacts to those jobs. By also tagging with
# the $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG, we allow subsequent pipelines to refer to
# images built on a given branch, which is used for caching.
#
# When building the image, we get caches from
#  - $rust_toolchain_image_name:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG and
#  - $rust_toolchain_image_name:$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH.
# That is, from previous builds on the same branch and from previous
# builds on the master branch.
#
# The inputs of this image are the set of paths defined in
# 'images/rust-toolchain/inputs'.
